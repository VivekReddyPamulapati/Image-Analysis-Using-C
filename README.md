# Image-Analysis-Using-C
This is a problem solving exercise 

In online we get many pictures that are identical but taken by different person, or a cropped version of a picture, this maybe pliagarism or some body just wanted only 

Here I compared different images and then verfied if the one image is subset of other image assuing that the reolution and bit depth of the images are same 

I ahve returned a table containg data about which images are subset of other images
